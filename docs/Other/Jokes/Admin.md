# The Admin

The admin is an incredibly rare species, known for emitting godlike abilities over the races below them.
Often any kind of issue is blamed upon these rare and mystical beings. Have a bad day, Badmin. Ate something poisoned, Badmin. Family murdered, Badmin.

It is not however, unprecedented an admin interfering in the daily operations of something and giving godlike abilities or various powers.
Known events include:

Omnitraitor:
> When an admin gives godlike power to a random crewmember combining multiple abilities such as a wizards magic, changeling abilities and syndicate gear
which inevitably causes damage to the station and crew. If you see one of these beings, kill them with fire or when fire is not enough...

Adminbus:
> When an admin has gotten too bored of watching ordinary operations of the station they can excert their powers to add an event that may or may not destroy the station.

Abuse:
> If you see an admin doing this, report the abuse to your nearest command center. There is a group of powerful admins, known as headmins that are grouped nomially with the station.
It may be possible to prevent future incidents and loss of profit.

# Operations and rules

As an admin you have a great many powers that can do an incredible amount of harm and also fun when used.

There are however a few policy examples that you may be required to follow depending on server:

Low interference:
> This policy you should avoid affecting the round if at all possible, this means before enacting punishment or temporary jail on someone make sure they have actually done something wrong.
Taking someone out of a round even for a few seconds and especially at a critical juncture can cause untold and permenant damage.
Although you would still have a lot of lee-way which is natural as an admin, know that introducing events or any kind of adminbus should be approved by a vote of the players
on the server. Unless the impact of the event is predicted to be so low that the round should not have a big effect.

Med interference:

> This policy allows more freedom in affecting the players and the server as a whole. Although it still doesn't allow you to introduce admin-buses whenver you like, the
adminbus may no longer need a vote. You can also jail players without researching into a sitation for a discussion. 
This would depend on the predicted impact of the adminbus, for example introducing an admin spawned traitor could be done withoutvote. 
This depends on individual server policy however.

High interference:

> Admins can do almost anything they want. Spawn a shade of the night that hunts down players? A Blob to consume all or start a new cult to narsie? All is allowed.
This does not mean you can just go doing events every single round though, that is a quick way for the events to get old. The rule of fun still exists.

Fun interference:

> The point of the game is to have fun. Interference of any kind have a decent possibility to affect that, if a player asks to switch antagonist roles... That isn't nessisarily a bad thing.
If a player does something vaguely against the rules and says that it was for the fun of the server, instead of being a rules lawyer consider doing a vote before a ban or just use judgement.
Did this player make the round more fun? If it's a yes, the whole event was likely for the good of the game as a whole. After all, if you're not having fun. What's the point?
Note, if the player specifically targetted someone to ruin their round as much as possible regardless of whether other people found it funny... Rule 1: Dont be a dick.

# Keep it professional.

Being an admin is easily abused, with all that infinite power it can and has previously gone to peoples heads. The best admins are the ones that stick to the rules but give people
the benefit of the doubt before instantly banning someone. It's entirely possible to mis-understand something and temporary bans are almost always preferable to permenant ones.
Banning everyone who plays the game not only affects the server your on, but how the game is to the player you banned. What if your ban caused that player to give up on playing?

Just keep in mind, the player should know what servers mean what:

LRP
MRP
HRP

Although this system is flawed, it should be more like:

-1
> No rules, do what you want barring sexual abuse or something stupid. Rule 1: Dont be a dick. Is still in affect but random killing, poisoning or sabatoge is likely allowed.
0
> Rules are beginning to be enforced, you are expected to avoid killing unless attacked first and sabatoging the station is dis-allowed without reason..
1
> Rules are now enforced, you are expected to avoid killing without a reason EG: someone critted or killed you earlier and you got revived. They were trying to kill you. 
Sabatoge should not be done unless you have a reason to EG: Antagonist.
If you are a command personel you are expected to do your job.
2
> Rules enforced, you are now expected to do your job as a station crewmember within reasonable standards including command personel. 
Random killing is not permitted and escalation rules apply EG: Fighting someone may be okay but if you are knocked down and taken to medbay, you are expected to first approach
security about them being punished. If in the event security outright refuses to punish the person you may attack them.
In the event you are an antagonist, you should avoid killing unless it's in your objective. Go for that greentext instead of messing around.
With hijack you may simply be required to kill off station population.
3
> This is the borderline for RP servers.
You are expected to roleplay situations, instead of attacking with force you must roleplay a reason for the attack. EG: Insulting someone and if they return the insults you may 
attack. As this is proper escalation.
You are expected to avoid killing if at all possible, if you have an antagonist objective you are expected to roleplay the kill.
4
> This is classified as HRP.
Every action must be roleplayed, barring minor actions like eating or making things.
Attacks must have proper reasons.
Killing should be avoided even if attacked first.
Before killing depending on server, ask an admin.
